// stock deployment every browser call reaches the backend through the
// SvelteKit node server (frontend/src/hooks.server.ts proxies /api), so
// Connection.RemoteIpAddress is that container, identical for every user on
// the platform. Left as-is, two things go wrong:
//
//   - The login limiter partitions on it, so its 5-attempts-per-minute budget
//     is shared by the entire user base instead of being per-client.
//   - AuditEvent.Ip / AuthEvent.Ip record a constant, which is worthless
//     for the "where did this come from" question they exist to answer.
//
// ForwardedHeadersConfiguration rewrites RemoteIpAddress from X-Forwarded-For
// but ONLY for connections coming from a proxy the operator declared trusted,
// so an untrusted caller cannot spoof its own address. This helper just reads
// the result and normalises it.
